# Contributing to Pybullet Industrial
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

or just spotting spelling mistakes in the documentation.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Making changes 
In order to avoid multiple people working on the same problem please first discuss the change you wish to make via GitHub issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Once changes are discussed the actual changes to the codebase are proposed using pull requests (see  [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for more information):

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure that all tests pass.
5. Make sure your code  follows the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code style.
6. Issue that pull request!

Once the pull request is issued, automatic tests will check that the code follows all code conventions, and passes all tests.
Once these tests give their ok, one of the repositorie maintainers will review the code.
If he is satisfied the code will be merged with the main branch.
Otherwise the maintainer might suggest changes that should be made to the code before it is accepted.
These changes might include, deleting unnecessairy comments, deleting unused files or refractoring overly complicated code passages.
These suggestions are generally designed to ensure the continued usability and maintainability of the code base.

## Seeking support
If you have questions about how to use this project, please open a GitHub issue using the question template.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
