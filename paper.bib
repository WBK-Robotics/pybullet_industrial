abstract = {Simulation comprises an indispensable set of technological tools and methods for the successful implementation of digital manufacturing, since it allows for the experimentation and validation of product, process and system design and configuration. Especially in todays’ turbulent manufacturing environment, which is affected by megatrends such as globalisation and ever-increasing requirements for higher degree of product customisation and personalisation, the value of simulation is evident. This keynote paper investigates the major milestones in the evolution of simulation technologies and examines recent industrial and research applications and findings. Based on this review, the identification of gaps in current practices is presented, and future trends and challenges to be met on the field are outlined. The considered simulation methods and tools include CAx, Factory layout design, Material and Information flow design, Manufacturing Networks Design, Manufacturing Systems Planning and Control, Manufacturing Networks Planning and Control, Augmented and Virtual Reality in product and process design, planning and verification (ergonomics, robotics, etc.). The evolution, advances, current practices and future trends of these technologies, industrial applications and research results are discussed in the context of the contemporary manufacturing industry.}

abstract = {This paper presents ray casting as the methodological basis for a CAD/CAM solid modeling system. Solid objects are modeled by combining primitive solids, such as blocks and cylinders, using the set operators union, intersection, and difference. To visualize and analyze the composite solids modeled, virtual light rays are cast as probes. By virtue of its simplicity, ray casting is reliable and extensible. The most difficult mathematical problem is finding line-surface intersection points. So surfaces such as planes, quadrics, tori, and probably even parametric surface patches may bound the primitive solids. The adequacy and efficiency of ray casting are issues addressed here. A fast picture generation capability for interactive modeling is the biggest challenge. New methods are presented, accompanied by sample pictures and CPU times, to meet the challenge.}
