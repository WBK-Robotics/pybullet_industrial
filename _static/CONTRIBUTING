<h1>Contributing to Pybullet Industrial</h1>


<p>We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reporting a bug</li>
<li>Discussing the current state of the code</li>
<li>Submitting a fix</li>
<li>Proposing new features</li>
</ul>

<p>or just spotting spelling mistakes in the documentation.</p>

<h2>Report bugs using Github's <a href="https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues">issues</a></h2>

<p>We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by <a href="https://github.com/WBK-Robotics/pybullet_industrial/issues/new/choose">opening a new issue</a>; it's that easy!</p>

<h2>Making changes</h2>

<p>In order to avoid multiple people working on the same problem please first discuss the change you wish to make via GitHub issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.</p>

<p>Once changes are discussed the actual changes to the codebase are proposed using pull requests (see  <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html">Github Flow</a> for more information):</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork the repo and create your branch from <code>main</code>.</li>
<li>If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.</li>
<li>If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.</li>
<li>Ensure that all tests pass.</li>
<li>Make sure your code  follows the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a> code style.</li>
<li>Issue that pull request!</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the pull request is issued, automatic tests will check that the code follows all code conventions, and passes all tests.
Once these tests give their ok, one of the repositorie maintainers will review the code.
If he is satisfied the code will be merged with the main branch.
Otherwise the maintainer might suggest changes that should be made to the code before it is accepted.
These changes might include, deleting unnecessairy comments, deleting unused files or refractoring overly complicated code passages.
These suggestions are generally designed to ensure the continued usability and maintainability of the code base.</p>

<h2>Seeking support</h2>

<p>If you have questions about how to use this project, please open a GitHub issue using the <a href="https://github.com/WBK-Robotics/pybullet_industrial/issues/new/choose">question template</a>.
This will help us keep track of how people are using the project, and help us improve the documentation.
Please dont contact the maintainers directly with questions about how to use the project.</p>

<p>If you dont have a question but something is not working as expected, please open a GitHub issue using the <a href="https://github.com/WBK-Robotics/pybullet_industrial/issues/new/choose">bug report template</a>.
This will not only help keep track of bugs but only prevents you from wasting time on a bug that is already known.</p>

<h2>Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License</h2>

<p>In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT License</a> that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.</p>

Pybullet_industrial is a process-aware robot simulation.
It aims to enable scientists and researchers to easily simulate robotics scenarios where a robot is participating in a manufacturing process.
It achieves this by combining the world of classical robot simulations with the world of industrial processes.
The library is capable of simulating different manufacturing tools and workpieces, as well as the robot itself.
With the help of the pybullet_industrial package you will be able to:

- simulate additive manufacturing processes
- simulate milling processes and how the resulting forces impact the robot
- simulating paint coating scenarios
- simulate the handling of complex tasks using a variety of grippers

## Documentation

You can find the documentation [here](https:&#x2f;&#x2f;pybullet-industrial.readthedocs.io&#x2f;en&#x2f;latest&#x2f;).


## Getting Started

There are two ways to get started with the library. The first is to use the newest source version from the repository.
The second is to use the latest release version from pip. The source version is the most up-to-date, but it is also the most unstable.
The release version is the most stable, but it is also the least up-to-date.
The release version is recommended for most users, but the source version is recommended for developers.


### Getting started with the release version

The release version is the most stable version of the library. It is recommended for most users. To install the release version, run the following command:

```
pip install pybullet_industrial
```

### Getting started with the source version

The source version is the most up-to-date version of the library. It is recommended for developers. To install the source version from the repository, run the following commands:

```
    git clone https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;WBK-Robotics&#x2f;pybullet_industrial
    cd pybullet_industrial
    pip install src&#x2f;
```

Note that if you are on windows, you may need to use the command `pip install src\\` instead.
And depending on how you have installed your python environment, you may need to first install `wheel` using `pip install wheel`.
